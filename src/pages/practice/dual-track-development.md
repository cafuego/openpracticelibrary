whatIs: Dual Track Agile is a way to weave together the critical work of
  Discovery and Delivery needed for strong product development. Lynn Miller
  wrote about the approach in a 2006 paper titled "[Case Study of Customer Input
  For a Successful
  Product](https://research.cs.vt.edu/ns/cs5724papers/miller.agile.pdf)". It was
  later popularised by Jeff Patton, and Marty Cagan.
whyDo: >-
  Dual Track Agile helps address some of the challenges teams experience with
  handing over work during the product development life cycle. Working with dual
  tracks can help:


  * Surface and align unavoidable dependencies

  * Build shared understanding through cross collaboration

  * Minimise rework and facilitate prioritisation

  * Validate learning before development begins
howTo: Put discovery tasks into the backlog
